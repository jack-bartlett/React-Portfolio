Cole is an artist I have the utmost respect for. This was 12 days with the entire studio booked, 6 rooms constantly recording, and countless other little speaker setups for additional producer cookups in hallways, in between the rooms, and where ever possible. Over 100 artists and producers were at the Dreamville camp and magic was made daily on the spot. It was like being in a fantasy world for everybody involved, artists included. The Milwaukee Bucks even dropped by and brought Krispy Kreme doughnuts for Everybody ðŸ˜‚.",
